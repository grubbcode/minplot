# minplot
minplot.py - a somewhat minimalist general-purpose python library for creating various plots and graphs.

Produce bar graphs, line plots, scatterplots, piegraphs, boxplots, errorbars, heatmaps, multipanel displays and more with 
plenty of control over plot options, axes, legends, colors, transparency, and other details. Graphics are produced in SVG format.
Your plot data can come from a database or anywhere else, and can be represented as an array of dict or other similar 2-D python 
iterable. Numeric, categorical, and dates/times are all supported.  Developing graphs with minplot.py is meant to be agile, rapid, 
and straightforward. To get started download minplot.py and import it. The minplot.py API is procedural and non-complex.
